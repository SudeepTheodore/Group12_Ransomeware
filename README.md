In our project the method is divided into four primary stages: infection, monitoring, detection, encryption and decryption, and mitigation. Initially, encryption is done using a symmetric AES key, just like ransomware does in the real world. A social engineering phishing attack is used to mimic the illness. In order to monitor, identify, and lessen the ransomware's effects, subsequent phases entail putting security measures and tools like antivirus and intrusion detection systems into place. These phases prioritise end-user education and practical defence applications.
